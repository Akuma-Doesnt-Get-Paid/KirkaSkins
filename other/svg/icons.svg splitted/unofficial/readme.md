The original svgs are images that are using an embedded base64 png.

Basically in the SVG sits a PNG -> it is not a real vector, just a representation of a PNG.

I converted the images using https://www.recraft.ai to a SVG. They are not 100% perfect, but they can be zoomed without quality loss. Can be used for custom images...
